[TERA Toolbox](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox) mod which ensures that your Elite/Tera Club Everful Nostrum (and/or Noctenium, depending on what your region offers) is up 100% of the time. 

Complete rewrite of Pinkie Pie's TEN mod that gets rid of various race conditions/bugs and adds functionality:
- Added support for auto-updating, a graphical user interface for settings, and more.
- Added support for all game regions.
- Added support for other premium items, for example premium nocts (JP).
- Added advanced features such as not overwriting Phoenix/Res Invincibility buffs.
